# Ogmios

From the developer at [ogmios.dev/faq](https://ogmios.dev/faq) :
"Ogmios is a lightweight bridge interface for `cardano-node`.
It offers a WebSockets API that enables local clients to speak Ouroboros' mini-protocols via JSON/RPC.
Ogmios is a fast and lightweight solution that can be deployed alongside relays to create entry points
on the Cardano network for various types of applications"_

It is a very convenient component of the Cardano ecosystem that many projects take advantage of as part of their projects.
Today we are going to set it up alongside our running `cardano-node`

Ok, next let's grab the latest static binary of the arm build from the developer.
(Hosting this one locally on our server for ease.)

``` bash
wget http://10.20.20.101:3001/ogmios -O /home/n/preview/bin/ogmios
```

Let's make the binary executable.

``` bash
chmod +x ~/preview/bin/ogmios
```

Let's make this API endpoint available externally.

``` bash
sudo ufw allow 1337/tcp
```

Reload ufw

``` bash
sudo ufw reload
```

Check ufw status

``` bash
sudo ufw status
```

You should see port 1337 on the list.

## Make a script

Now we need to create a script to start `ogmios`.

``` bash
nano ~/preview/scripts/ogmios_start.sh
```

Next, let's give it the correct startup options.
You'll notice some of the startup options on `ogmios` is similar to `cardano-node`.
We are going to set the port to 1337, and the IP to listening at `0.0.0.0`.

Add the following to the `ogmios_start.sh` file you just opened in nano.

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
#
/home/n/preview/bin/ogmios --node-socket /home/n/preview/socket/node.socket \
--node-config /home/n/preview/config/config.json \
--host 0.0.0.0 \
--port 1337
```

Save and exit `ctrl + o` and `ctrl + x`.

Make the script executable.

``` bash
chmod +x ~/preview/scripts/ogmios_start.sh
```

Let's test the script in our terminal window.

``` bash
cd ~/preview/scripts

./ogmios_start.sh

```

While this is running, open a browser window on your machine and enter the URL of your server on port `1337`

Example: [http://10.20.20.101:1337](http://10.20.20.101:1337)

You should be greeted with a nice dashboard.

Go ahead and kill the running process in your terminal with `ctrl + c`

Next, let's automate the script with systemd.

## Make the Service

Create the sample service file.

``` bash
nano ~/preview/scripts/ogmios.service
```

Add the following basic systemd configuration to the file you just opened with nano.

``` bash
[Unit]
Description       = Ogmios
Wants             = network-online.target
After             = network-online.target

[Service]
User              = n
Type              = simple
WorkingDirectory  = /home/n/preview/scripts/
ExecStart         = /bin/bash -c '/home/n/preview/scripts/ogmios_start.sh'
KillSignal        = SIGINT
RestartKillSignal = SIGINT
LimitNOFILE       = 24000
Restart           = always
RestartSec        = 7
SyslogIdentifier  = ogmios

[Install]
WantedBy          = multi-user.target
```

Copy the service file to the system directory.

``` bash
sudo cp /home/n/preview/scripts/ogmios.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

Give the service the correct permissions.

``` bash
sudo chmod 0644 /etc/systemd/system/ogmios.service
```

Reload daemons.

``` bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Start the `ogmios` service.

``` bash
sudo systemctl start ogmios.service
```

Check the service.

``` bash
sudo systemctl status ogmios.service
```

If it shows `active`, we can enable the service.

``` bash
sudo systemctl enable ogmios.service
```

Go open your `ogmios` dashoboard again in your browser and proudly observe the fruits of your labor.
